 *
 *      + contains `beforeViewUpdateTaskQueue` and `afterViewUpdateTaskQueue` that can be used to add one-time/recurring tasks to execute before and after view update.
 *      + requires an implementation of `getFeatures` that exposes features that should be surfaced
 *      + will post `shouldRegenerateViewEventName` events when a view generation is necessary

/**
 * The basic prototype for creating an efficient implementation of ViewFunction.
 *
 * This prototype provides two core properties:
 *
 *    + `targetView`: contains the output view. The `view` function will first call `regenerateView` to recreate the `targetView` if necessary and then return the modified `targetView` as output.
 *    + `lastSourceView`: contains a previous snapshot of `sourceView` that was passed as argument in last invocation of `view` function. This property could be combined with `shouldRegenerateView` to create a way to determine whether the target view should be regenerated in `regenerateView`.
 *
 * In addition, `AbstractViewFunction` provides two task queues to add tasks that should be executed before/after updating target view one-off/every-time.
 *
 * To extend `AbstractViewFunction`, derived classes should override `regenerateView` to create target view efficiently.

Setting this value to `true` is useful when `setWindow` is triggered by an instance which handles this event. For example, `BasicView` handles this event by calling `refreshView` which will call the `setWindow` function. Therefore, to prevent double re-rendering, the `setWindow` call from `refreshView` should have this parameter set to `true`. This applies to other scenario where the caller of `setWindow` is responsible for actually rendering the view.

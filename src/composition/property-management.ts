   * If computation of property's value is expensive, then this property might want to set `thisValue.shouldReuseLastValue` to a predicate function that when evaluates to true, allows this computed value, which can be retrieved using `manager.getPropertyValueSnapshot`, to be reused.
   *
   * Such pattern is safe as long as the predicate will evaluate to `false` when the value in snapshot outdates. If this assumption cannot be guaranteed, then `__getValue` should set shouldReuseLastValue to `undefined`, which is also the initial value.
   *
   * ! In order to support auto-discovering of dependencies among properties, all references to other properties managed by specified manager should happen in the manner `manager.getPropertyValue(<property name>)` where `<property name>` should be the literal string of the other property's name.
   *
   * For example, suppose property A's value is the sum of the values of property B and C, its `__getValue` might look like the following:
   *
   * ```
   * __getValue(thisValue: Property<TPropertyValue>, manager: PropertyManager) {

   *   return result;
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * During resolution, both property B and C will be recognized as prerequisites for property A.
   *
   * Above code is efficient since `manager.getPropertyValue` will delegate to property's `getValue` method which will reuse snapshot value if that value is up-to-date. Otherwise, a recomputation is unavoidable and caching ensures computation only occurs once to update necessary property prerequisites.
